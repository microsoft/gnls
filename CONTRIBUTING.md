## Prerequisite

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)
- C++ build tools required by [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)
- (Optional) clang-tidy and clang-format

## Build and Run

After cloning the repo, run these commands to install or update dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

Run these commands to build a package for release:

```
pnpm run build
pnpm run package
```

To develop or debug, open the code folder in VS Code, install the recommended extensions for code intellisense and debugging support.

Some tasks and debug configurations are provided for your convenience:

- `Build` task: build the JavaScript and C++ code.

  This is usually sufficient for development as other things rarely change and can be built with `pnpm run prepare`, which is already done when doing `pnpm install`. By default, this can also be invoked with keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>.

- `RunTest` config: run the tests.

  `Build` task is automatically invoked before running.

- `RunExtension` config: run the extension in another VS Code instance for debugging.

  `Build` task is automatically invoked before running. This only attaches to the client code, so if you want to debug the server or native addon code, use the other two configs.

- `AttachServer` config: attach to the language server.

  This only works when `RunExtension` is in running state. You will be able to debug the JavaScript part of the language server.

- `AttachNode` config: attach to the language server node process.

  This only works when `RunExtension` is in running state. Filter the process list with keyword "gnls", choose the node process, then you will be able to debug the C++ native addon.
